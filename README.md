# Reason for extra time

The reason we needed the extra time is for some different reasons. Firstly, github was giving some issues while in class, the repository wasn't connecting to the laptop, and when it did, it just gave and error about how the file size was too big. Another reason is that figuring out how to add in a DLL in that amount of time was quite challenging. The time loss from the github issues didn't give much time to work on anything except a small bit of the primative asset's and a idea of how to implement the design element. Having this extra time allowed us to achieve more out of the bonus assignment, and be able to properly deliver the required deliverables in a less stressful environment.


# Design Pattern(s)

Observer 

The observer pattern was used for this project, when left clicking on the mouse, the text at the top of the screen, as well as the character changes between different colours. The colours swap through 5 different sets, the observer looks out for when an action is done by the user, this being a left click of the mouse button, doing this feedback is sent to the user that their action updated a part of the game. While it isnâ€™t directly functionality/gameplay based, it allows the user to have a little bit of freedom with customization, letting them choose a colour they want, and what they want the title colour to be.
