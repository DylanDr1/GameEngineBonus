# Reason for extra time

The reason we needed the extra time is for some different reasons. Firstly, github was giving some issues while in class, the repository wasn't connecting to the laptop, and when it did, it just gave and error about how the file size was too big. Another reason is that figuring out how to add in a DLL in that amount of time was quite challenging. The time loss from the github issues didn't give much time to work on anything except a small bit of the primative asset's and a idea of how to implement the design element.
